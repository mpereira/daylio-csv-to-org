   For now =daylio-csv-to-org= requires [[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html][Java]] and [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] to run. If others
   manifest interest I may publish static binaries for convenience.

   #+begin_src text
   $ lein run -- --help
     Short  Long option                    Default  Description
            --content-max-line-length      78
            --heading-max-length           60
            --heading-timestamp-enabled    true
            --heading-timestamp-show-time  false
     -h     --help                                  Display usage summary and exit
     -i     --daylio-csv-input                      Path to a Daylio CSV export file
     -o     --org-output                            Path to the resulting Org file
   #+end_src

   Assuming a Daylio CSV export like the one below:

   #+begin_src text
   $ cat daylio_export.csv 
   full_date,date,weekday,time,mood,activities,note_title,note
   2023-01-08,8. Jan,Sunday,13:12,good,Sleep 8 hours | Read book | Meditated,,Got back to reading novels this afternoon. Meditated for 30 minutes and went to bed.
   2023-01-07,7. Jan,Saturday,22:00,great,Sleep 8 hours | Friends | Walk 10k steps | Workout,,Met John and Mary at the gym. We lifted weights and then came back to my place for dinner.
   2023-01-06,6. Jan,Friday,22:00,bad,Stress | Shoulder pain,,
   #+end_src

   The command below would convert it to an Org file, which can be visualized
   with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] on a computer, or [[https://plainorg.com/][Plain Org]] on an iPhone.

   #+begin_src bash
   lein run \
        --daylio-csv-input daylio_export.csv  \
        --org-output daylio.org

   Using [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]], the Org file could be converted to many other formats, like
   HTML, and visualized pretty much anywhere.

   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc \
     -f org \
     -t html \
     -o daylio.html \
     daylio.org
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src bash
   open daylio.html
   #+end_src
