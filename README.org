  A library and CLI to convert [[https://daylio.net/][Daylio]] [[https://faq.daylio.net/article/29-what-is-csv-and-how-it-looks#:~:text=To%20export%20CSV%20just%20go,the%20app%20of%20your%20choice][CSV exports]] to [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] files.

   For now =daylio-csv-to-org= requires Java and Leiningen to run. If others
   manifest interest I may publish static binaries for convenience.

   #+begin_src text
   $ lein run -- --help
     Short  Long option                    Default  Description
            --content-max-line-length      78
            --heading-max-length           60
            --heading-timestamp-enabled    true
            --heading-timestamp-show-time  false
     -h     --help                                  Display usage summary and exit
     -i     --daylio-csv-input                      Path to a Daylio CSV export file
     -o     --org-output                            Path to the resulting Org file
   #+end_src

   A command like the one below would convert the
   =/Users/jdoe/daylio_export_2023_01_01.csv= Daylio CSV export into a
   =/Users/jdoe/org/daylio.org= Org file.

   #+begin_src bash
   lein run \
        --daylio-csv-input "/Users/jdoe/daylio_export_2023_01_01.csv" \
        --org-output "/Users/jdoe/org/daylio.org"
   #+end_src

   Using [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]], the Org file could then be converted to many other formats,
   like HTML:

   #+begin_src bash
   pandoc \
     -f org \
     -t html \
     -o daylio.html \
     "/Users/jdoe/org/daylio.org"
   #+end_src

   And visualized in a web browser:

   #+begin_src bash
   open daylio.html
   #+end_src
